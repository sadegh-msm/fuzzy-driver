# Self-Driving Car with Fuzzy Logic

This repository contains a project that implements a self-driving car using fuzzy logic principles. The self-driving car utilizes sensors to perceive the environment, applies fuzzy logic to make decisions, and controls the car's actions accordingly.

## Project Overview

The self-driving car project consists of the following components:

1. **Sensor Inputs**: The car is equipped with various sensors, such as distance sensors, camera sensors, and speed sensors. These sensors provide information about the car's surroundings and current state.

2. **Fuzzy Logic Controllers**: The project utilizes fuzzy logic controllers to make decisions based on the sensor inputs. Fuzzy logic enables the car to handle uncertainty and imprecise information effectively.

3. **Decision Making**: The fuzzy logic controllers analyze the sensor inputs and generate appropriate decisions for the car. The decisions can include actions like accelerating, braking, steering, or changing lanes.

4. **Control System**: The control system of the self-driving car translates the decisions made by the fuzzy logic controllers into actual control signals for the car's actuators. These control signals determine how the car should maneuver and interact with its environment.

## Fuzzy Logic Controllers

The fuzzy logic controllers used in this project are designed to handle specific aspects of the self-driving car's behavior. Some example fuzzy logic controllers might include:

- **Obstacle Detection**: This controller analyzes distance sensor inputs to detect obstacles in the car's path. It uses fuzzy sets to determine the degree of danger posed by the obstacle and decides whether to stop, slow down, or change lanes.

- **Lane Keeping**: This controller uses camera sensor inputs to detect lane markings and ensure the car stays within the designated lanes. It employs fuzzy logic to determine the required steering angle to keep the car centered within the lane.

- **Speed Control**: This controller utilizes speed sensor inputs to regulate the car's speed based on the road conditions and surrounding traffic. It adjusts the acceleration and braking based on fuzzy rules to maintain a safe and comfortable speed.

## Usage

To use the self-driving car project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the necessary hardware components, including sensors and actuators, to enable communication between the car and the control system.

2. Implement the fuzzy logic controllers based on your specific requirements. Customize the membership functions, fuzzy rules, and defuzzification methods to suit your project's needs.

3. Connect the sensor inputs to the fuzzy logic controllers and design the decision-making process. Determine the appropriate control actions based on the sensor inputs and fuzzy logic analysis.

4. Implement the control system to receive the decisions from the fuzzy logic controllers and generate control signals for the car's actuators. Ensure the control system is capable of translating the decisions into proper car movements.

5. Test the self-driving car in a controlled environment, such as a closed track or simulation, to observe its behavior and make adjustments as needed. Continuously refine the fuzzy logic controllers and control system to improve the car's performance.
